# Bamazon

## Hello, I am the creator of Bamazon. To start Bamazon, simply pull from my GitHub. GitIgnore should ignore the node modules. To start, simply type [node bamazon.js]. Fullscreen console please.

## This will bring a console log table from cli-table2 in the form of this
![pic of start](/images/bamazonStart.jpg?raw=true "Start of Bamazon")
## Then, the user will be asked through inquirer.js about which item to buy and how much of this, if an item is chosen and bought, this will be brought up
![pic of purchase](/images/bamazonPurchase.jpg?raw=true "Bamazon Purchase")
## Finally, if the user opens bamazon again in the console, we can see the change to the quantity
![pic of change](/images/bamazonChange.jpg?raw=true "Bamazon Change")
##If you are need of an Amazon clone to purchase items, Bamazon is your app!
